        <h2>Benefits of Doing Pranayama</h2>

       <br>
        <li>Cognitive function. Both slow and fast kinds of pranayama can help improve your cognitive functions. Studies show that fast pranayama in particular can help to improve auditory and sensory-motor skills.

           </li><li> Lung capacity. Practicing pranayama can help improve lung function. This includes helping you hold your breath longer and increasing strength in your respiratory muscles. Pranayama has the potential to help with all sorts of lung issues. It may aid recovery from pneumonia and strengthen lungs that suffer from asthma.
            
           </li><li> Quit smoking. Speaking of lung health, the breathing techniques in pranayama can help to cut cravings if you want to quit smoking.
            
           </li><li> Mindfulness. Much like the more popular forms of yoga, pranayama can increase mindfulness. Its meditative method of breath focus and awareness can aid your ability to live in the present moment.‌
            
           </li><li> Stress and emotional regulation. Pranayama’s ability to improve mindfulness has also been found to lower stress and aggression among students taking particularly stressful exams. Pranayama’s focus on breathing and relaxation may alter the levels of stress molecules.
            
            </li><li>Anxiety. Pranayama can significantly lower anxiety levels and any negative feelings associated with it. Regular pranayama practice can help with anxiety. It can also improve areas of mental focus that are often affected by it such as awareness and attention. Just one session can help you to noticeably reduce anxiety.
            
            </li><li>Reduce hypertension. Bee breath pranayama and chanting may help reduce hypertension or high blood pressure. The benefits of such stress reduction include reducing the chance of various conditions, such as strokes, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary heart disease.‌
            
            </li><li>Psychosomatic disorders. Psychosomatic disorders are diseases involving both the body and mind. Some psychosomatic diseases include migraine headaches, ulcers, and psoriasis. By joining the body and mind through the breath, pranayama may help manage these. </p>

<h2> Practicing Pranayama</h2>
<p>As with any new exercise, it is always best to talk to your doctor before taking on a new routine. Try to begin a pranayama practice slowly and then build it up over time.
