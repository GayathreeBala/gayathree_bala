<h4 style="margin-left: 30px;" class="col-12 col-md-8">Yoga philosophy</h4>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;" class="col-12 col-md-8">Yoga must be approached initially as a philosophy–but a philosophy which by its very nature stimulates its investigators to engage in practical applications through which they will experience (and demonstrate) for themselves its truth and worth. That which begins as theory develops into practice which culminates in realization. Yoga is thus a philosophy, a discipline, and an experience. It is a revelation of consciousness. It is also a statement of Things As They Are, Things As They Should Be, and Things As They Shall Be. These three considerations, like yoga itself, possess the dual nature of theory and objectification. Yoga, then, is both philosophy and science. And since rational thought always precedes rational action, we should begin with the philosophical side of Yoga.

<h4 style="margin-left: 30px;" class="col-12 col-md-8">Then and now</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 30px;" class="col-12 col-md-8">In the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita Krishna tells Arjuna: “Truly there never was a time when I was not, nor you, nor these lords of men–nor in the future will there be a time when we shall cease to be” (Bhagavad Gita 2:12). That is, we are eternal beings, without beginning and without end.

Originally we were sparks or points of conscious light in the infinite Ocean of Conscious Light that is God. We were gods with God. And so we still are, for it is not possible to be outside of Infinity Itself, however much the fever-dream of delusion may instill in us the illusion of separation. Yet we are also here in this world, a place that completely overwhelms the truth of our immortal life within God and blinds our awareness to anything but the ever-changing mode of existence within this plane of matter and mortality–the momentary projection of the divine power known as Maya, the dream-power of the Divine Dreamer. For countless life-cycles we have found ourselves embodied in material cases, little body-prisons within the greater prison of the cosmos. And that is where we are right now.

There is a law that governs the place and kind of our embodiment. That law is karma, the principle of exact and inevitable reaction to our own actions and mental states, resulting in a seemingly endless domino effect of continual birth and death within matter. Yoga offers us the possibility of ending the bewildering chain of embodiments by awakening to find ourselves outside of time and mortality and in eternity and immortality–where we have always been.

<div style="background-color: lightgreen;color:darkgreen"><h4 style="margin-left: 30px;" class="col-12 col-md-8">God and gods</h4>
<br><p style="margin-left: 30px;" class="col-12 col-md-8">
We are gods within God, finite spirits within the Infinite Spirit. But what is “spirit”? Yoga tells us that spirit is consciousness, hence we are eternal consciousnesses, each of us eternally individual and distinct (“nor in the future will there be a time when we shall cease to be”). Yet we are more. For we do not each have an existence independent of one another or independent of God who is the Supreme Spirit. Rather, we take our being from God as the waves take their existence from the ocean. God is the eternal Root or Ground of our being, our greater Self. We are not God, but in some ineffable manner God is us: the Self of our self, the Spirit of our spirit. God is all, and we are the parts, each of us possessing an eternal and irrevocable distinction. That is why, as already quoted, Krishna told Arjuna: “Truly there never was a time when I was not, nor you, nor these lords of men–nor in the future will there be a time when we shall cease to be.” This is incalculably important to realize before we can have any viable understanding or approach to ourselves, to our lives, to others, and even to God. The distinction between God, us, and one another is real and eternal. Yet so is our unity.

“The Atma and Paramatma are essentially of the same nature and represent the ‘Many’ and ‘One’ aspects of the same Reality. In Hinduism, the ‘One’ or the universal aspect is emphasized to such an extent that many people think that when Self-realization takes place the Atma disappears completely and finally into the Paramatma and its separate identity is lost for ever, an idea which has been beautifully expressed by Edwin Arnold in the sentence ‘the dewdrop slips into the shining sea.’ But…in Self-realization, the center of the Atma, which is eternal, remains, though the circumference becomes larger and larger and after union with the Paramatma has no limiting and binding power on the individual Atma.” (Taimni, The Ultimate Reality and Realization, p. 95)

In God there is unity; in us there is diversity. These two seemingly contradictory states coexist in perfection. Because of this we have the term advaita which does not mean “one,” but simply “not two.” Otherwise absolute monism would be the eternal state, but it is not; and neither is absolute dualism. It is neither One nor Two. It is Not Two, a unity that possesses diversity. It is a mystery, but it can be realized by direct experience, and yoga is the means to that experience.

Since we are consciousness, authentic yoga deals directly (and only) with consciousness. Except for those things that facilitate success in yoga practice, yoga does not concern itself with any physical, psychic, or intellectual byways that by their very nature are outside spirit and therefore mutable, mortal, and fundamentally alien to us. Ideally yoga does only one thing: the development-revelation of consciousness. You will experience this for yourself by practice. And when we speak of consciousness we do not mean “consciousness of spirit,” as though spirit were an object and consciousness of spirit only a condition of awareness, but spirit itself which is consciousness, the eternal subject. Wherefore to enter into union with God and one another is simply to be in our truest state of being.

<h4 style="margin-left: 30px;" class="col-12 col-md-8">God and creation</h4>
<p style="margin-left: 30px;" class="col-12 col-md-8">
God, the infinite Spirit, is pure consciousness, but, as we are experiencing even now, he has extended or emanated himself as the cosmos: physical, astral, and causal. This seemingly dual nature of God as Light and Power, as Consciousness and Matter, has puzzled the minds of even the wise. And this is nothing to be surprised about considering how utterly beyond human intelligence is the Divine Nature. But, as Paramhansa Yogananda often said, God cannot be understood or known, that is, in the relative sense, with the finite mind, but God can be realized. Yoga is the means of that realization.

God, the Original Being, projects Himself as the ever-changing dance of creation, as the evolving light that is the cosmos. God projects the creation, evolves it, and withdraws it back into Himself in a perpetual cycle. Thus the creation can be thought of as God’s body, that God becomes incarnate in creation again and again. And as parts or reflections of God we do exactly the same through reincarnation.

All conscious beings have existed eternally within the Being of God, living within the heart of God, one with Him, distinct though not separate. Having their being rooted in the infinity of God, the individual consciousnesses have within them a natural impulse to transcend their finitude and attain the boundlessness of their Origin. This, of course, is impossible, since the essential, eternal nature of a being cannot be altered. Being rooted in God, and therefore in a sense a part of God, all beings are as immutable as God, the only infinite Being. Yet the urge for transcendence is part of their nature.

The solution to this dilemma is actually quite simple: the individual consciousnesses cannot alter their natural state of finitude but they can come to share and participate in the infinite Consciousness of God. As Sri Ma Anandamayi said: “The soul can become godlike, but it cannot become God.” That is, they cannot become infinite themselves, but they can experience the infinity of another: their divine Source. Just as a psychically sensitive person can experience the thoughts and feelings of another by tuning in to him, yet in no way becoming that other person, so the individual consciousness can come to experience the Consciousness of God while remaining in its limited native state.

It is necessary, however, for the individual spirit to develop the capacity for such a state of awareness. And this is done by learning to fully experience the state of existence of a being completely different from oneself–to enter into an altogether alien mode of being while retaining the awareness of one’s true identity. In other words, the individual spirit must learn to put on the “costume” of a consciousness utterly different from its own and become able not just to fully experience that other mode of consciousness, but also to develop the ability to function as that other kind of being.
